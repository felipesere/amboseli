For a little script that I run every day as a form of "journal", 
I've been experimenting with using Markdown as a file format and
Typora as my "UI", and I quite like it!

What makes Markdown so practical as a format/UI:
* It can be aesthetically pleasing and is endlessly themable
* Intuitive and consise markup, including todos!
* Easy to view with tools with fancy tools (Typora et all) or simple tools (vim, cat, Notepad.txt)
* Easy to search with tools like `ripgrep`, Spotlight, or Windows Search
* Easy to version with `git` and the `diffs` are meaninguf
* Easy to share with Github, Dropbox or email (_and the receiver can use any tool to view it_ :heart:)

There are also plenty of parsers out there for different languages,
so its fairly easy to automate the parsing, understanding, and creating
of Markdown.
