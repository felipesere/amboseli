# Welcome to the new look for felipesere.com

Inspiration:
* for the me page: https://github.com/christianmendoza/hugo-split-theme
* for the blogs themeselves: https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper/
* for the portfolio: https://github.com/ageekymonk/hugo-tracks-theme
* alternative for portfolio: https://gatsby-casper.netlify.com/ & https://github.com/scttcper/gatsby-casper

## Running in development
`npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`


## Design considerations

* Use few colours, focus on shades of grey and a clean blue.
* Use as little JS on the final site as possible.


> Currently the `portfolio` and `advent of code` sections are not ported yet.
