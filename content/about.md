_Hello!_

My name is Felipe and I've been writing software for the last 10 years.
I enjoy coming up with solutions to problems, no matter what language or framework we happen to use.
Throughout the years I've mentored apprentices to pass on some of what I've learnt about programming.

When I am not writing code myself, I help teams of engineers and managers think about their flow of work and value.
Together we come up with experiments that we can use to learn, iterate, and improve.

Other than that I enjoy taking pictures of things and travelling to sunny beaches.
