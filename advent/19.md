title: FZF in vim

I wrote about using `fzf` on the commandline yesterday.
But there is more!
FZF is lovely within `vim`.
It's a great replacement for `CTRL-P` or `Command-T` and other searchers.
The biggest gain for me was not needing a cache (_because it is that fast_) and not having to deal with installing (m)any dependencies.

Things you need to get started:

- fzf iteself and as a vim plugin from [junegunn/fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- fzf.vim for some special bindings from [junegunn/fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)
- ripgrep from [BurntSushi/ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

There is very little configuration needed.
For one, make sure that `fzf` globally uses ripgrep (`rg`) as its source, so in your ZSH/Bash config set

```bash
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND="rg --files"
```

if you haven't done so already.

With that you can search calling `:FZF`.
I was so used to hitting CTRL-P to search that I simply mapped it with

```
map <c-p> :FZF<CR>
map <leader>p :History<CR>
map <leader>g :GFiles?'<CR>
```

I also added mapped a bunch of other things I tend to do:
List recently used files and search across changed files in git.

There are plenty more shortcuts to be explored in `fzf.vim`. Enjoy!
