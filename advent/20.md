title: Motions in vim

A few [days ago](https://www.felipesere.com/advent/?day=15) I showed a little map I used to learn `vim` navigation back when I was an apprentice.
My friend [Andy](https://twitter.com/AndyPalmer) suggested I describe repeated movents.

And I also wanted to describe other motions in `vim` I used quite often.

Andy mentioned the repeated motion.
Something like `d3te` translates to **d**elete un**t**il **3** **e**.
The image below shows what would happen:

![Deleting until the 3rd `e` to the right](vim-repeated-motion.jpg 'Deleting until the 3rd `e` to the right.')

The key that makes it repeated is the `3`.
This turns the command from "delete until before an `e`" into "delete until before the third `e`".
You can swap the `d` for a `c`, which changes the command from _delete_ to _change_.
This means `vim` will _change_ those charcters, which removes the characters and drops you back into insert mode.

A notion I use very often is `ciw`: change in word.
Its the one that symbolises the speed with which to edit text in vim: Wherever I am, whoever long the word is, changing it takes 3 key strokes followed by the new word.

![Change in word](vim-word-motion.jpg 'Motion to change an entire word.')

The image shows how I change "jumped" into "ran".
Most of the time, word boundaries are what one believes they are.
What is more fun -- particularly when programming -- is to change _in_ or _around_ quoted strings or variations of parenthesis:

![Change in and around pairs](vim-in-and-around.jpg 'Change in and around characters that come in paris')

This time I added qutoes aorund _"brown fox"_ to demonstrate the difference between _in_ and _around_.
Nr 1. shows that when you hit `ci"` vim will allow you to change the charaters within a string,
while nr. 2 shows that `ca"` will also chew up the quotes.

I use this a _LOT_ when I want to move quoted strings around, depending on whether I need to keep the a string in place (`di"`) or one to more it wholesale (`da"`).

Its also super practical for anything in round `(`, square `[`, or curly `{` parenthesis!
