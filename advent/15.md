title: Map to navigate vim

They say a picture speaks a thousand words.
So here is a a little map similar to the one I had drawn when I was an apprentice, learning the ways of vim.

On this map, assume the cursor is pretty much in the middle, on the blue highlighted `m` in _jumped_.

The blue lines are basic word navigation, mostly navigating to the edges of the word and then jumping across the gap.

The yellow lines _find_ characters, `f` for forward and `F` for backwards.
The key thing is that it will jump to the next closest character.
In this case `fz` jumps to the `z`.

`t` in red/orange is very similar to `f`, it jumpes the character _before_ the in the sequence.
Read `tg` as _"search '**t**ill g"_.

Lastly, the green lines take you to the beginning (`^`) and end (`$`) of a line.

Let me know if you find this map useful.
