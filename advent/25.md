So we've arrived at the end! The last day of advent blog series.
I've shwn a bunch of tools that (mostly) use and some shortcuts for git, the shell, and vim.
For screen captures I mostly used this blog as a source for searches, changes, etc.

One tool I haven't mentioned but used pretty much exclusively throughout this month is the actual terminal I use: [jwilm/alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty).

Why use Alacritty and not one of the more common alternatives like iTerm or Terminal.app?

Alacritty is written in Rust and designed from the ground up to use the GPU for rendering.

It does not come with a lot of features - scrollback was just resently added - which is a concious effort to keep the project and codebase focused.
According to its author, Alacritty should stay focused on being a fast terminal while delegating other responsibilities to something like `tmux`.

As a result, Alacritty is pretty fast.

Another feature I particularly like over iTerm is that its configuration lives in a single, large yaml file.
From there you can configure everything from fonts, colors, keybindings, and the initial shell.
You might wonder why this matters?
Having the configuration in a single file means I can easily drop it into `git` and share it across multiple devices.
I tried this with iTerm and it just got messy.

Alacritty currently supports Mac, Windows, and Linux, making it a viable portable options.

On Mac, its as easy as `brew cask install alacritty`!
