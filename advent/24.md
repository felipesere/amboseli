title: Nice and tidy neoformat

`ELM` and `gofmt` made having a single, uncontested code style sociable.
Since them, others have followed with `rustfmt`, `mix format` (Elixir), and `prettier` (everything JavaScript).
Admittedly, I may have the order wrong, but it doesn't matter.
Gone are the days of debating where curly parenthesis or overly long argument lists go.

Almost. While the debate is over, we now have to run different tools. Constantly.
For vim, I found [sbdchd/neoformat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat).

It follows on the same path as other tools like [w0rp/ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) that no (\_or only minimal) configuration and work with that is already on your system.

Install it via vim plug:

```vim
Plug 'sbdchd/neoformat'
```

and that is pretty much it!

Mind you, you might have to install different formatters for different languages, as those are not reimplemented in VimScript.
For example, I had to `npm installl -g prettier` to have it pickup prettier.
The slight catch I can foresee is my local setup and CIs prettier version diverging... This hasn't happend yet, but it should be something to look out for!

What I like is that no matter what language is setup, there is a single entry point to run a formatter: `:Neoformat`.
