`ripgrep` is a brilliant text search tool for the command line.

For one, it is blazing fast. I use it on a daily basis on a large-ish (?) JavaScript code base and it has never let me down.

I’d even take it a step further: I think tools like ripgrep are what allows us to have larger codebases precisely because it allows to forget where the code is and then find it again. I am so used to the speed now that I am annoyed when I have to wait for an IDE to update its index.

So how do you use it? The same way you'd use `grep`:

![regular-grep](regular-grep.png 'Searching for foo with grep')

All I wanted to say was _“find all occurrences of foo in this repo”_, but I had to specify a couple of arguments to make it work with regular old `grep`: `-r` to make the search recursive and `src` to narrow down the search to a folder, as it would have otherwise dug its way through the entirety of my `node_modules`.

Here is what the same search looks like with `ripgrep` or `rg` for short:

![Search for foo with ripgrep](ripgrep.png 'Faster alternative: search for foo with ripgrep')

Instant difference: it was automatically recursive, avoided sifting through `node_modules`, and it has colors!

Oh, and its just blazing fast. Though to be fair to `grep` (and `git grep`) that is the case for most small-to-medium directories anyway.

The fact that it did not look into `node_modules` stems from the fact that`rg`understands your `.gitignore` and other version control system files out of the box. How neat is that?

A flag that I often use because I have a hard time remembering case is `--ignore-case`. If you don't want to specify that flag aaaall the time, you point ripgrep to a configuration file with the environment variable `RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH` and then add any defaults you want to set in there as "normal" flags to ripgrep.

If you want to give it ago, its a simple `brew install ripgrep` away

I also suggest looking through the repo at [BurntSushi/ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) on Github. Its a great Rust project to look into and learn from.

Enjoy searching!
