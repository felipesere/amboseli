title: Continously running tests

When doing test-driven development it is almost guaranteed that you'll want to run your tests right after you have made some changes.
Some programming languages and frameworks support this out of the box:

```bash
jest --watch
```

for JavaScript or

```bash
mix test.watch
```

for Elixir with the `mix-test.watch` plugin.

There are some great alternatives out there, [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) being my current favorite due to its user experience.
The key flags that I keep coming back to:

- `--exts js,css,scss` to narrow down the file extensions. No regexes needed!
- `-i` to ignore files that are not already ignored by your version control system
- `-c` to clear the screen
- `-r` to restart any servers that stay running

So if I had to run a command in Docker when any of my JavaScript or JSX files changed, I would do something like this:

```bash
watchexec --exts js,jsx -c -- docker rmi -c "make test"
```

See the `--`? That means I don't have to put the Docker command itself in quotes!

Enjoy running, and re-running, and re-re-running your tests today!
