Part of a team working on a pilot of an Electron-based application deployed
to retail stores in the UK.
We helped steer the team to make small experiments and deploy often, 
 as well as putting in the effort to keep the growing codebase maintainable.  
**Stack**: JavaScript, React, Redux, Electron, Linux, Node.
 
 
Currently working in the medical sector creating an application to 
support hospital staff with medical trials.  
**Stack**: Golang, React, Redux, AWS


The focus of my mentoring shifted from apprentices in our office to 
my fellow crafters in projects.
This involves technical advice on the current code base, as well as 
career development for colleagues in other projects and the office.
