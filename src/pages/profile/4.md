Part of a team working on coaches brought into a large manufacturing company
to support the development of an ordering system.
While we worked hands-on in the codebase, showing ways to refactor and re-architect
the stack, we also closely advised the local leadership on Agile principles and ideas.  
**Stack**: Java, C#, Silverlight, JavaScript, Angular 

I prototyped an ingestion pipeline in Elixir for a subsidiary of a compnay in the insurance sector.
Our team was tasked with helping the company build a data pipeline to better
inform business decisions and support their partners.  
**Stack**: Elixir, AWS, React, JavaScript, SQL

Helped a retail company in the UK by mentoring a small team in 
Agile principles and values while continuously shipping Java application.
We explored their path to off-premise infrastructure and brought
their new-found DevOps team and legacy software engineers together.  
**Stack**: Java, AWS, Docker


When not working on projects I mentored multiple apprentices
to become successful crafters at 8th Light.
