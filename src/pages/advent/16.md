title: Quickly format JSON in vim and shell

When working with JSON APIs, there will come the time when you want to quickly sift through a large response to find some specific key-value pair.
You might start by just loading it in the browser and going through ti with the regular search.
Great. You found what your were looking for.

Then you realize you want some more context, so maaaybe you happen to have a plugin like [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en)
to get a more structured view of the response

So far so good. But what about when you want to modify that JSON? Previous solutions were read-only.
What I've usually done in such a situation is to download the JSON response to my laptop, open it in `vim` and modify it any way I needed.

The catch is that just downloading an unformatted pile of JSON is annoying.
But there is a clean solutions: `jq`. Granted, its command line interface is a bit quirky, and I always have to look up its filter syntax, but its quite useful for quick formatting.

Paste the JSON blob into an empty buffer, and then run `:%! jq .` to have the buffer refilled with the formatted json!
Isn't that neat?

Let's take that command appart to see how we could extend it:

`:%!` send the entire buffer to the standard input of the next command.
You could tune this to only process a part of a file by visually selecting a chunk, then hitting `:` and vim will append a `:<,>`.
The `! jq .` would stay the same.

`jq` is the program doing the filtering. You can install it with hombrew like `brew install jq`.

The single `.` is quite clever. Its a filter. More precisley, its the _identity function_, meaning that it will return anytihng passed to it, albeit formatted.
You can use it to narrow down the JSON you want back, though the syntax is cryptic at times. Read me about it in the [jq docs](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters)

And that is it!
You use the first half of the command to space the range of text to go _in_, and the filter at the back to narrow down the JSON you get back.

Enjoy!
