title: More uses of "git branch"

Git branch is severly under-used! It is often used to list local branches (`git branch ...`) or even remote branches (`git branch -a ...`).

But there are a few more valuable usages:

- `git branch --move (-m) <new-name>` to rename a branch!

- `git branch --merged` to see which branches have already been merged to **master**

- `git branch --delete (-d)` to remove a _merged branch_ and -D to remove an _unmerged_ branch

- `git branch --contains <sha>` to see which branches already contain a commit

Its a good habit to look for stale branches that have already been `--merged`and `--delete` them.

I use `--contains` quite often to make certain features -- squashed commits recently -- are merged into master.
