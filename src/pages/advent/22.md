title: Launching vim into the README.md file

Yesterday I presented my little [search](https://github.com/felipesere/search) convenience plugin.

Well, here is another one! The [felipesere/vim-open-readme](https://github.com/felipesere/vim-open-readme) plugin does one thing, and it does it well:
when launching `vim` without any extra arguments, it will look for a README.md and open it by default.

This is nothing fancy, but proves quite handy. 
It makes vim behave a little bit like GitHub, where the `README.md` has become synonymous with a landing page.

Here is a recording of it in action

Install it using `vim plug` like so:

```vim
Plug 'felipesere/vim-open-readme
```

And there is literally nothing to configure! 
Enjoy!
