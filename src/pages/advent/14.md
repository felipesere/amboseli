title: Recording videos from the terminal

This one is going to be short and sweet: have you heard of [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) ?

Its this funky little utiltity that lets you record your interaction with the terminal! How cool is that?

Install it with `brew install asciinema`  and record anything simply by running `asciinema rec`.

Here is an example of a recording that I did for a vim plugin I extracted recently:

[![Search plugin in vim](https://asciinema.org/a/JBepEOiwov6fHSYxL8Rsv5sLN.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/JBepEOiwov6fHSYxL8Rsv5sLN 'ASCII video of my little plugin in a a vim session')

I really like how simple and uncomplicated it is.

Once you are done recording, it gives you the option to either upload the cast to the asciinema site and give you a link _or_ give you a .cast file to use for whatever you need.



Once I figure out how to make it retain the vim colors, I can absolutely see myself adding more of these to the coming posts!
