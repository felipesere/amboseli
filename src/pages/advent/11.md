title: Looking to Make Changes

Todays tip is valuable if you are not into IDEs (_for practical or sentimental reasons_) and you want to do whole-project search-and-replace operations.
Let's make it even harder: say you know you want _some_ of the replacements, but you know you'll get some false positives.
That makes running `sed` over the directory pretty hard.
You could run `sed` followed by `git checkout -p` to undo some of the changes. But that would be boring.
Plus, it's pretty hard/annoying to preview the results of `sed`.

There is an alternative: `fastmod`. [facebookincubator/fastmod](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fastmod) is a fairly simple tool
that has a single purpose: _interactive search & replace_.

Say we wanted to replace `foo` with `bar` in the text.
Running `fastmod foo bar` would lead to one these:

![Rejecting a change in fastmod](./fastmod1.png 'Here is a change we dont want')

Ha! We were hoping to find `foo` in our prose, but obviously `footer` also fits the bill.
But the key feature is at the bottom of the screenshot: we get to say no.
This search and reaplce is interactive!

Here is a hit we are keen on:

![Accepted change in fastmod](./fastmod2.png 'Much better hit!')

What I really like is the preview and the choice to skip a suggestion.

There is one more feature: regular expressions.
Its a bit long to explain here, but you can capture groups to grab parts of the search and paste it into your replacement.

Here I am changing all the `className={...}` declarations to insert an `awesome` prefix:

![Fastmod regex](./fastmod-regex.png 'Search and Replace on the commandline with a regex')

Tricky bit: regexes. I suggest looking at the Rust [regex docs](https://docs.rs/regex/1.1.0/regex/) for how to properly escape things.
As an example, I had to escape the `{` with a *\* as it was otherwise being picked up as a number.

I don't use `fastmod` super often, but its really handy when I do need it.
