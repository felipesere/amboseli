title: Looking to Make Changes

How often do you find yourself...
...trying to make a change across multiple files?
Lets make it even harder: say you know you want _some_ of the replacements, but you know you'll get some false positives.
That makes running `sed` over the directory pretty hard.

You could run `sed` followed by `git checkout -p` to undo some of the changes. But that would be boring.
Plus, its pretty hard/annoying to preview the results of sed.

There is an alternative: `fastmod`. [facebookincubator/fastmod](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fastmod) is a fairly simple tool 
that has a single purpose: _interactive search & replace_.
