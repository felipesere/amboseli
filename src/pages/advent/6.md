Let's do some more colours!
A few months ago I swapped regular `ls` with `exa` written in Rust. The reason? The color and information defaults are way more useful in `exa` than in `ls`.
Take a look at these screenshots of the same folder:

![Regular ls](./regular-ls.png 'Barely any colors, what are all those numbers?')

The first columns explains the permissions the files and folders have, the second is the number of hard links to the file or directory, the third and fourth are ownership, the next one is size in bytes (!), followed by the update time and the actual name of the file/folder.
You can add the `-h` flag to make the sizes **h**umanly readable and play with the `LSCOLORS` variable to highlight some elements.

Now compare this to the default output of `exa -l`:

![Exa ls](./exa-ls.png 'Color coded permissions and files, human readable sizes')

I have not configured any particular colors for this! 
The permissions are lovely tabulated and color coded to instantly spot the odd one out.
`exa` assumes that a human will read the output and converts the sizes to meaningful numbers.
It also works to group files by kind and highlight them differently (hence `README.md` looks different from `move-content.rb`).

For my regular usage I have a `alias 'ls=exa -l'` setup as `ls` is just so ingrained in my muscle memory.
Most other flags I tended to give `ls` have vanished as I can get pretty much get all I need from the default look.

I recommend checking out [https://the.exa.website/](https://the.exa.website) for more flags and instructions on how to install it.
