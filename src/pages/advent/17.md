title: FZF and enhancd

Have you heard of FZF or _fzf_?
On the surface, _fzf_ is simply a fuzzy matcher taht works across input given to it.
But given that it is decoupled from the source of the input, it can be combined and intertwined with ohter programs 
to create quick, slick user intefaes.

There are two integrations I want to share with you today:  `fzf + enhancd` and `fzf + ctrl-t`.

> Instruction on installing `enhancd` are [here](https://github.com/b4b4r07/enhancd#package-installation) and for `fzf` [here](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation)

`enhancd` is a ZSH/Bash plugin that _enhances_ navigating across directories.
I mainly use two integrations, one for `cd` and one for `cd -`.
Normally, a bare `cd` would send you back to your `$HOME` directory. 
When you have the plugin activated, `cd` will list directories you have visted and allow you to filter them down.
This is where `fzf` comes in. `fzf` is the tool for you to do preciesly that filtering.

Even `cd -` has been enhanced! Normally it would take you to the previous folder, which in and of itself is pretty nifty (_fyi `git checkout -` works the same way_).
Enhanved steps it up a notch by giving you a list of the 10 previous folders to fuzzy find across.
This means you no longer have to hope the last folder you came from was the right one.
Take a look:

Lastly, I got this one from a co-worker of mine.
If you install _fzf_, you get a bunch of shell bindings that are super useful, amongst them `CTRL-T`.
This binding will allow you to fuzzy match across any file and folder in the current directory.
Once you hit enter it just pastes the path under the cursor. 
That may not sound fancy, but its super valuable when you want to narrow down the scope _of other commands_.

Say you want to run a single file of specs with in Elixir with `mix`.
You can type `mix test ` then hit `CTRL-T`, find the right file, and then hit enter again.
That will have prepped the command line for you to do just what you need.
And given `fzf` fuzzy nature, you don't need to remember the precise name of the file/folder:

Hot tip connecting my previous tip to use `ripgrep` on [day XX](...):
Set `export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND="rg --files"` and `export FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND="rg --files"` in your ZSH/Bash config to get blazing fast files.

**PS: I originally wanted `asciinema` videos showing the usage, but `fzf` does not show in those videos...**
