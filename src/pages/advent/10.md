title: Looking for files

How often do you find yourself looking for files?
Like, _hmmmm, what are all the markdown files again?_ or _I know I changed the file in the last three days..._, or _which files are larger than a megabyte?_
Often enough, I'd reach to `find` the answer. 
Having done it enough, I commited some incantations to memory: `find . -name \*.md` to find Markdown files and `find . -mtime -3` for files changed in the last few days.
While the that clearly works (and there are way more options to find!) these are pretty tedious.

There is a lovely alternative called `fd` that providers a nicer _user experience_.

For one, `fd` _assumes_ you intend to find a part a of the filename, so `fd md` is the same as `find . -name \*md\*`.
There is a way to prevent spurious files with `...md...` in the middle (I couldn't think of any...): You can use `-e` to narrow down the file extension and `-t f` to narrow down the type to files.

How about the second check? It will not get really shorter, but it will become much clearer:
`fd --changed-within 3days`. Instead of days you can use `min`, `sec`, `weeks` or any other.
The alternative to `--changed-witin` is `--changed-before` in case you are looking for particularly old files.

The size query is actually quite similar: `find -size +1kb` vs `fd -S +1k`. Not everything needs reinventing, right?

You might also notice that `fd` is faster and gives you fewer results.
This is because it understands your `.gitignore` and does not need to crawl the depths of your `./node_modules` (assuming you write JavaScript).

If you want to try it yourself, you can install it with `brew install fd`. Head over to [sharkdp/fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for more details.

This is one that I intend to use waaay more!

PS: `fd` is written by the same person that wrote `bat`!
