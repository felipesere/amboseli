title: Search and replace in vim

There are plenty of ways and parameters when searching and replacing text in vim.

A first thing that makes the experience nice are three settings in your `.vimrc` (or `.config/nvim/init.vim`):

1. `set hlsearch` to highlight all matches across the file
2. `set incsearch` to show matches as you type them out
3. `set inccomand=nosplit` preview the substitution as you make it


To search for things it `/` in command mode and start typing.
The common way to replace across the current file is `%s/something/else/g` which replace `something` with `else`.
But there is a handy shortcut.
If you manage to highlight the word(s) you want to replace - either with `/something` or by hitting `*` for the word under the cursor - you can simply type
`%s//else/g` and vim will use the the highlighted word as the source of substitution.
