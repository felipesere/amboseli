title: Colours and numbers on the command line

Sticking to the theme of adding colours to the command line: Have you noticed that neither `cat` nor `less` are pretty rudimentary in what they display?
Obviously they were written under certain constraints, but they have not evolved since.

There is a nice alternative I tend to use: [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

It a lovely drop-in for `cat` that has a few key features that make it stand out:

- Tries to autodetect file type
- Themeable colors
- Shows line numbers
- Displays changes (addition and modifications from git)

The reason I care so much about line numbers, colors, and git, is that I rarely _just look_ at a file. Often time, I am looking for an error _based on a given line number_ and then syntax highlighting acts as an initial litmus test.
With the git support, I can then see if that line has been changed recently.

While my `vim` setup covers most of these, `bat` is nice for ad-hoc quick inspections.

For the brave ones amongst you that want to ditch `cat` entirely, you can add `alias cat='bat'` to your shell profile.
