title: Brace for a shell

While building this blog I have had to move some files and folder around so I thought I share a small *nugget* around braces and shell expansion.

When moving files you'll usually do `mv some/path/foo some/path/bar` or the old-fashioned backup strategy `mv file.txt file.backup.txt`. In essence `mv` _source_ _destination_.

But there is a lovely to abbreviate both of these commands: `mv some/path/{foo,bar}` and `mv file{,.backup}.txt`
The curly brances `{` and `}` emphasise exactly what should be different betwee _source_ and _destination_.
In the first example we are entirely substitute `foo` with `bar`. 
While the second one looks different - particularly the comma followed by the brace `{,` - it works the same way:
subtistute _nothing_ with `.backup` between `file` and its extension `.txt`.

You can take this further, by listing more things in the parenthesis you can have the command expanded to each choice.
I use this for example to quickly create a the file structure from Maven:

![Creating folders quickly](./braces.png 'Quickly create folders with expansions')

One trick I just learnt this morning is that the shell expansion also works for ranges!
This way you can create a new JSON file for the 7 days of the week:

```bash
touch {1..7}.json
```

And keep in mind, this can be combined:

```bash
mkdir -p {1..7}/the_middle/{A-D}
```

will produce:
![Creating folders with ranges](./folder-ranges.png 'Double nested ranges')

Granted, I don't use this syntax as often, but I found it curious and fun that I thought I'd share it!
